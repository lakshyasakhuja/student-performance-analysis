# Analysing Student Performance Using Data Science

This repository contains a **group project for DATA2002 (Data Science, Big Data and Data Diversity)** from the **University of Sydney (Semester 2)**.

The project applies **exploratory data analysis and statistical reasoning** to investigate factors influencing student academic performance, using real-world educational data. The work was completed collaboratively as part of **Group L21G05**, with all analysis conducted using **R and Quarto**.

---

## 📘 Project Overview

This project explores how **demographic, academic, family, and lifestyle factors** relate to student performance outcomes. Using data from Portuguese secondary schools, the analysis examines patterns in grades across subjects and identifies variables that may contribute to academic success or risk.

The project focuses on:

- Understanding differences in performance across subjects  
- Examining demographic and family background influences  
- Analysing academic behaviours such as study time and prior failures  
- Identifying early indicators of final academic outcomes  

---

## 🎯 Research Focus & Motivation

Educational performance is shaped by more than classroom instruction alone. This project was motivated by the need to understand:

- Why performance varies significantly between subjects  
- How gender, parental education, and family structure influence outcomes  
- Whether early academic indicators can predict final results  

By applying data science techniques, the project aims to provide **evidence-based insights** that could inform targeted educational interventions.

---

## 📊 Analytical Approach

The analysis follows a structured **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** workflow:

- Data cleaning and preparation  
- Visual exploration of demographic and academic variables  
- Comparative analysis between mathematics and Portuguese subjects  
- Examination of grade progression across assessment periods (G1, G2, G3)  
- Interpretation of relationships between lifestyle factors and performance  

The emphasis is on **interpretation, reasoning, and clarity**, rather than black-box modelling.

## 📈 Key Findings

Key insights from the analysis include:

- **Subject Performance Gap:** Portuguese students consistently outperform mathematics students, with more stable grade distributions  
- **Gender Differences:** Female students achieve higher grades across both subjects  
- **Family Impact:** Parental education levels strongly correlate with academic success  
- **Academic Predictors:** Past failures and study time are strong indicators of final grades  
- **Early Prediction:** First-period grades are highly predictive of final outcomes  

These findings highlight opportunities for **early intervention**, particularly in mathematics education.

## 🧾 Reproducible Workflow

All analysis and reporting were developed using **Quarto (`.qmd`) in R**, ensuring:

- Reproducibility of analysis  
- Clear separation of code, narrative, and output  
- Professional reporting suitable for both academic and analytical contexts  

The repository includes:
- Quarto source files (`.qmd`)
- Final rendered report (`.pdf`)
- Exploratory data analysis documentation
